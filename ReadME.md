# TheBest-Blog-forTechies


## Description
This was a challenge to work with the MVC dynamic. The student was to utilize their skills with SQL and sequelize to build a database and front-side Client view with handlebars. The goal was to create a blog that the user had the ability to login/sign-up as well as logout. To view the different blogs used and then to have some security utilized. The design is rudimentary but works well.
